            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I have always been using technology, from the age of six years old. I have always had an interest in computers and websites as a whole.</li>

            <li>Courses I'm taking and reasons for each: 
                <ul>
                    <li>ITSC 3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society - The impact of technology on society is always changing and this helps take things into perspective.</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security & Priv - An attempt to branch out and learn other areas of Computer Science</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development - Another attempt to branch out into other areas of Computer Science, more practical for me in my opinion.</li>
                    <li>ITCS 3160 - Database Design and Implementation- A challenging yet important area of Computer Science that I wish to attempt to learn.</li>
                </ul>

                I am the first generation of my family to be born in America.</li>
