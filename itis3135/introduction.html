            <li>Personal background: Born and grew up in NC, family is from Vietnam. Been in Charlotte my whole life. Born in 2001. Live with my family consisting of my mom, dad, and younger sister.</li>
            <li>Professional: I have only ever had an internship as a "legitimate" job. The internship was for my high school senior exit project at a Charlotte Esports Org. Otherwise I have helped at the family business.</li>

            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I have always been using technology, from the age of six years old. I have always had an interest in computers and websites as a whole.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Self built desktop computer running windows 10 at home and a Dell laptop for work.</li>

            <li>Courses I'm taking and reasons for each: 
                <ul>
                    <li>ITSC 3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society - The impact of technology on society is always changing and this helps take things into perspective.</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security & Priv - An attempt to branch out and learn other areas of Computer Science</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development - Another attempt to branch out into other areas of Computer Science, more practical for me in my opinion.</li>
                    <li>ITCS 3160 - Database Design and Implementation- A challenging yet important area of Computer Science that I wish to attempt to learn.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                One of my earliest memories is when I was playing at my grandparent's house in Vietnam and fainted due to dehydration, I played until I fell!
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I am the first generation of my family to be born in America.</li>
        </ul>
