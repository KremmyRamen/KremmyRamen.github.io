            <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
            <a href="https://mediadistribution.espn.com/"><h3>ESPN Media Distribution</h3></a>
            <p>This website is the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network's (ESPN) Media Distrubution page for ESPN, where they advertise their broadcasts. I will examine the landing page.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast -  The main color red at the top and bottom is bright and popping, contrasting with the monochrome video, which contrasts with the different topics at the bottom. It is very clean and not confusing at all.</li>
                <li>Repetition - The term ESPN is put front and center the moment the page is loaded, but not repeated often as it is a small landing page, allowing the name of ESPN to always be prevalent on the page. The top menu bar  always present while scrolling as well.</li>
                <li>Alignment - ESPN has a very simple yet effective alignment, the entire page is even and fits to the window and results in a clean website.</li>
                <li>Proximity - This is probably ESPN's strongest aspect, proximity of the landing page is sectioned off into three sections, making it very obvious what is what.</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="http://www.roverp6cars.com/?LMCL=ylvNGH"><h3>MGBD Parts</h3></a>
            <p>MGBD Parts is seemingly a car autoshop that sells parts. I really want to say this website is intentional satire because this is atrocious otherwise. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - This websites has eight (8) different colors with no rhyme or reason behind them. The font colors are all over the place, backgrounds leading to hard to read text. Plus it is just ugly. </li>
                <li>Repetition - The only hint of repetition on this page are the car brands on the left and pictures on the right, but even then that is all over the place.  </li>
                <li>Alignment - The alignment is all over the place, there's a ton of pictures off center, weird sizes, bad fonts, bad colors, just overall a mess in terms of alignment </li>
                <li>Proximity - The proximity is actually somewhat existent as related topics are somewhat organized. There's the models on the left, ads in the middle, and pictures on the right. Suprisingly good for this website. </li>
            </ul>
