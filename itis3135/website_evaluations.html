            <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
            <a href="https://mediadistribution.espn.com/"><h3>ESPN Media Distribution</h3></a>
            <p>This website is the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network's (ESPN) Media Distrubution page for ESPN, where they advertise their broadcasts. I will examine the landing page.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast -  The main color red at the top and bottom is bright and popping, contrasting with the monochrome video, which contrasts with the different topics at the bottom. It is very clean and not confusing at all.</li>
                <li>Repetition - The term ESPN is put front and center the moment the page is loaded, but not repeated often as it is a small landing page, allowing the name of ESPN to always be prevalent on the page. The top menu bar  always present while scrolling as well.</li>
                <li>Alignment - ESPN has a very simple yet effective alignment, the entire page is even and fits to the window and results in a clean website.</li>
                <li>Proximity - This is probably ESPN's strongest aspect, proximity of the landing page is sectioned off into three different .</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="http://www.roverp6cars.com/?LMCL=ylvNGH"><h3>MGBD Parts</h3></a>
            <p>MGBD Parts is seemingly a car autoshop that sells parts. I really want to say this website is intentional satire because this is atrocious otherwise. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - This websites colors are just hard to look at, starting with the bright yellow background color. Even some of the figure background colors are hard to look at with this background in contrast. </li>
                <li>Repetition - This website is following repetition a bit by having the name of the website be listed all around, but they are not the same in CRAP standards </li>
                <li>Alignment - The alignment is close, but there is no straight invisible line that is being followed throughout the website </li>
                <li>Proximity - There is some linear detailing with proximity, but that just seems to be regular HTML standards making the site easily readable in some places</li>
            </ul>
